TEST: 



You have all weekend to complete this as well as the holiday on Monday. I need this returned by midnight on Monday night!

 

Database - Grocery store

Instructions:

In Python or Java, please complete the following coding exercise. It is up to you on how complex you’d like to get on implementation. 
A tar or zip of your files/results will be sent back to our team and reviewed. 

This exercise will take place at a Grocery Store. You are the new head of tech at Apple's Grocery Store. You have thus inherited a Database that is unfortunately just a List. This list is just an extremely long List of Grocery Items you sell, which are dictionaries.

Here is an example List:

[
    "GroceryItem": {
        "Name": <String>,
        "ID": <Long>,
        "ItemInfo": {
            "Description": <String>,
            "Category": <String>
        },
        "Sales": {
            "Price": <Float>,
            "Discount": <Float>
        },
        "Internal" {
            "Aisle": <Int>,
            "TimesSold": {
                "Today": <Int>,
                "Yesterday": <Int>,
            }
        }
    },
    "GroceryItem": {...},
    "GroceryItem": {...},
]



With this information we want you to complete some tasks:

1) Create a cashier checkout algorithm that takes in a list of tuples and is able to calculate the total cost after discount. Each tuple will hold ID and Quantity:
Ex [(145728, 2), (332457, 1), (589927, 4), (1235938, 1)]

2) To Increase sales we want more data on what has been working well. We want the top 2 most sold fruits from the last two days that had a discount.

3) The store has decided to move all grocery items under a dollar to a new aisle called Super Savings, which is in Aisle 15. Therefore move all items that are under 1.00 without the sale discount to Aisle 15. 

4) Apple had updated the database to be a json file instead of a list, so your input this time will be a .json. Please adjust your code accordingly and ask if you have questions on syntax


FAQs:

How many items are in the list, can it fit in memory?

1 million + 

Can I be provided the database schema?

Please create your own schema based on the list fields. 

How do I read data from the database?

The list is a file, your choice on how you store and query.

Am I allowed to use open source libraries?

Apache or GPL

Is the value in "Discount" the amount of the discount or the price after the discount has been applied?

Amount of discount.
